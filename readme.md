These are scenes, .yaml files used to create maps in [Mapzen's Tangram](https://mapzen.com/products/tangram/). 

I'm using these files to learn Tangram and GLSL.  

I've structured the code in most (but not all of the) files so that they should work (and display a map) if you
copy and paste the code into https://mapzen.com/tangram/play 

Most of the code in here is not written from scratch by me rather I've just adapted code written by Patricio Gonz√°lez Vivo of Mapzen, who deserves credit. 

Some of these scenes also include workable examples of shader code that you can insert into a scene with less fuss (hopefully). 

Below are descriptions and direct links to them in Tangram Play as well so you can view and edit them. 

Descriptions:

diagonal_dash: [viewable example]() Applies a diagonal dash pattern to your polygon style; different than the polygon strips which are continuous. Mentioned as the 'polygons-diagonal-dash' block and its [block reference](http://tangrams.github.io/blocks/#polygons-diagonal-dash)


line-dash-example: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https%3A%2F%2FrApply a diagonal dash pattern to the polygon styleaw.githubusercontent.com%2Fskorasaurus%2Fsc3n3%2Fmaster%2Fsimpler-line-dash-example.yaml#11.7500/41.4622/-81.7251)
Use dashes for your lines.

lines-chevron-example: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorasaurus/sc3n3/master/lines-chevron-example.yaml#18.50000/41.47735/-81.67940) - Chevron Lines 

lines-outline: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorasaurus/sc3n3/master/lines-outline.yaml#17.50000/41.47735/-81.67940) - Outlines to lines; used as road casings. 

polygon-stripes: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorasaurus/sc3n3/master/polygon-stripes.yaml#14.50000/41.47735/-81.67940) - stripes/hatchure s in polygons; see the waterway and the as two different examples. 
Also see [coastline-stripes.yaml](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorasaurus/sc3n3/master/coastline-stripes.yaml#13.50000/41.47735/-81.67940) done by Geraldine Sarmiento for a similar example.
 	
skim-city: a reimagination of the Sim City 2000 aesthetic (from the 1994 ish release). Designed to be viewed mostly at z15+ zoom level (since that's you'd usually play SC2000 at anyways). Really early stages; [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fskorasaurus%2Fsc3n3%2Fmaster%2Fskim_city.yaml#15.0000/41.5021/-81.6890)


(need to finish describing the rest of the files)

PS - global.yaml is filed referenced in several of my scenes, used to properly layer features. available at
