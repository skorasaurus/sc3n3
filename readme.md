These are scenes, .yaml files used to create maps in [Mapzen's Tangram](https://mapzen.com/products/tangram/). 

I'm using these files to learn Tangram and GLSL.  

I've structured the code in most (but not all of the) files so that they should work (and display a map) if you
copy and paste the code into https://mapzen.com/tangram/play 

Most of the code in here is not written from scratch by me rather I've just adapted code written by Patricio Gonz√°lez Vivo of Mapzen, who deserves credit. 

Some of these scenes also include workable examples of shader code that you can insert into a scene with less fuss (hopefully). 

Below are descriptions and direct links to them in Tangram Play as well so you can view and edit them. 

Descriptions:

skim-city: a reimagination in the sim city 2000 aesthetic. designed to be viewed mostly at z15+ zoom level (since that's you'd usually play SC2000 at anyways). Really early stages; [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fskorasaurus%2Fsc3n3%2Fmaster%2Fskim_city.yaml#15.0000/41.5021/-81.6890)


line-dash-example: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fskorasaurus%2Fsc3n3%2Fmaster%2Fsimpler-line-dash-example.yaml#11.7500/41.4622/-81.7251)
Use dashes for your lines.

lines-chevron-example: example of chevron Lines, [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https%3A%2F%2Fmapzen.com%2Fapi%2Fscenes%2F722%2F600%2Fresources%2Flines-chevron-example.yaml#19.00000/38.93663/-79.91654)

lines-outline: [viewable example](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorasaurus/sc3n3/master/lines-outline.yaml#17.50000/41.47735/-81.67940) - 

(need to finish describing the rest of the files)

PS - global.yaml is filed referenced in several of my scenes, used to properly layer features. available at
